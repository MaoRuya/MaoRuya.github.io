				<h3>Thanksgiving Day</h3>
				Thanksgiving Day is a traditional western festival. It is a festival created by the American people and a festival for American 
				families to get together. In the beginning, there was no fixed date for Thanksgiving, which was temporarily decided by the states 
				in the United States. It was not until 1863, after the independence of the United States, that President Lincoln declared 
				Thanksgiving a national holiday. In 1941, the U.S. Congress officially designated the fourth Thursday in November as "thanksgiving".
				 The Thanksgiving holiday usually lasts from Thursday to Sunday. In 1879, the Canadian Parliament declared November 6 a Thanksgiving
				  Day and a national holiday. In the following years, the date of Thanksgiving changed many times, until on January 31, 1957, the 
				  Canadian Parliament declared the second Monday of October as Thanksgiving. In addition to the United States, Canada, Egypt, Greece
				   and other countries in the world have their own unique Thanksgiving Day, but Britain, France and other European countries are 
				   isolated from Thanksgiving. Some scholars also proposed to set up "Chinese Thanksgiving Day" to promote traditional culture.
